# Two-Factor Authentication

Add an extra security layer by requiring a code from your authenticator app when you log in.

## Enabling 2FA

1. Go to Settings > Two-Factor Authentication
2. Click Enable 2FA
3. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
4. Enter the 6-digit code from your app
5. Click Verify & Enable

> If you can't scan the QR code, manually enter the secret code shown below it.

**Supported Apps:**

- Google Authenticator
- Authy
- Microsoft Authenticator
- 1Password
- Bitwarden
- Any TOTP-compatible app

## Logging In with 2FA

After entering your password, you'll be prompted for a 6-digit code from your authenticator app.

> Codes expire every 30 seconds. If a code expires, enter the new one.

## Disabling 2FA

1. Go to Settings > Two-Factor Authentication
2. Click Disable 2FA
3. Enter your password to confirm

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Code

Wait for the next code and try again. Ensure your device time is set to automatic.

### Lost Access to Authenticator App

If you lose access to your authenticator app, you cannot log in. Save backup codes in your authenticator app to prevent lockout.
