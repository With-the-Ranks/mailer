# Inviting Team Members

Only Admin users can invite new members to an organization.

## Email Invitations

Send a direct invitation to a specific email address.

### Steps

1. Go to Settings > Members
2. Click Invite Member
3. Select Email Invite tab
4. Enter email address
5. Select role (Manager or Admin)
6. Click Send Invitation

### How It Works

The recipient receives an email with an invitation link. They must sign in with that exact email address to accept.

**For existing users:**

- Click link
- Sign in
- Automatically join organization

**For new users:**

- Click link
- Create account with invited email
- Automatically join organization

> Email invitations do not expire and are validated against the user's authenticated email.

## Shareable Links

Generate a link that can be shared with anyone.

### Steps

1. Go to Settings > Members
2. Click Invite Member
3. Select Shareable Link tab
4. Select role (Manager or Admin)
5. Choose expiration:
   - 1 day
   - 7 days (recommended)
   - 30 days
   - Never expire
6. Click Generate Link
7. Copy and share the link

### How It Works

Anyone with the link can use it to join your organization.

1. Recipient clicks link
2. Signs in or creates account
3. Accepts invitation
4. Joins organization with assigned role

> Use short expiration dates (1-7 days) and revoke links after use.

## Role Selection

**Manager:** Can create campaigns and manage content, but cannot manage team members or organization settings.

**Admin:** Full control including team management and organization settings.

## Managing Invitations

### Viewing Pending Invitations

Go to Settings > Members to see:

- Active members list
- Pending invitations section

Each pending invitation shows:

- Email or "Shareable Link"
- Assigned role
- Who sent invitation
- Expiration date (if applicable)

### Revoking Invitations

To cancel an invitation:

1. Go to Settings > Members
2. Find invitation in Pending Invitations
3. Click X icon
4. Confirm revocation

The invitation link becomes invalid immediately.

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received

- Check spam folder
- Verify email address is correct
- Generate shareable link instead

### Email Mismatch Error

User signed in with different email than invitation.

**Solutions:**

- Sign in with invited email
- Use shareable link instead

### Already a Member

Person is already in the organization. To change their role, see [Managing Members](/docs/organizers/managing-members).

### Expired Link

Shareable link has passed its expiration date. Generate a new link.
