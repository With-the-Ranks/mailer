# Deliverability Best Practices

Best practices to ensure your emails reach the inbox.

## Email Content

### Subject Lines

- Keep them under 50 characters
- Be clear and descriptive
- Personalize when possible
- Test different variations

Avoid:

- Excessive capitalization
- Too many exclamation marks
- Spam trigger words
- Misleading promises

### Email Body

- Use a clear structure
- Include a clear call-to-action
- Keep paragraphs short
- Use images with alt text
- Write for mobile devices

Avoid:

- Too many different colors
- Too many links
- Overloading with images

## List Management

### Clean Your List

- Remove bounced addresses immediately
- Clean inactive subscribers (6-12 months)
- Segment your list
- Try to re-engage before removing

> Never use purchased email lists. This will damage your sender reputation.

### Unsubscribe Handling

- Provide clear unsubscribe links
- Process unsubscribes within 24 hours
- Honor preferences promptly

### Bounce Management

**Hard Bounces** - Remove immediately:

- Invalid email addresses
- Blocked domains

**Soft Bounces** - Retry temporarily, then remove:

- Mailbox full
- Server temporarily unavailable

## Authentication

Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records with your email provider. See the [Resend Integration guide](/docs/advanced-users/resend-integration) for detailed setup instructions.

## Testing Before Sending

Always test your emails before sending:

1. Send to yourself - Check formatting and links
2. Test on mobile - Most emails are read on phones
3. Test email clients - Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail
4. Verify all links work correctly

## Monitoring Performance

Track these key metrics in your Resend dashboard:

- **Open Rate** - Percentage of recipients who opened your email
- **Click Rate** - Percentage of recipients who clicked a link
- **Bounce Rate** - Emails that failed to deliver (remove these addresses immediately)
- **Unsubscribe Rate** - Recipients who opted out

Use [Gmail Postmaster Tools](https://postmaster.google.com/) to monitor:

- Spam rate
- IP reputation
- Domain reputation
- Feedback loop reports

### Warning Signs

- Increasing bounce rate - Clean your list
- Declining open rate - Review subject lines and sender reputation
- High spam complaints - Review content and list quality

## Warming Up New Domains

Gradually increase volume when setting up a new sending domain:

- Week 1: 50-100 emails/day
- Week 2: 200-500 emails/day
- Week 3: 1,000 emails/day
- Week 4+: Full capacity

## Common Mistakes

- Using link shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl)
- Deceptive subject lines
- Missing unsubscribe links
- Using no-reply addresses
