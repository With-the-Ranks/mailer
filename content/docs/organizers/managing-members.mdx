# Managing Team Members

Only Admin users can manage team membership and roles.

## Accessing Member Management

Go to Settings > Members to view:

- Active members with roles
- Pending invitations

## Viewing Members

Each member displays:

- Name and email
- Role badge (Admin or Manager)
- Actions menu (for Admins)

Your own member entry shows a "You" badge.

## Changing Member Roles

### Steps

1. Go to Settings > Members
2. Find member in list
3. Click three-dot menu
4. Select:
   - Make Admin (if currently Manager)
   - Make Manager (if currently Admin)
5. Role updates immediately

### Restrictions

**Cannot demote the only Admin:**

If you're the last Admin, you cannot change your role to Manager.

**Solution:** Promote another member to Admin first.

> Keep at least 2 Admins to prevent organization lockout.

## Removing Members

### Steps

1. Go to Settings > Members
2. Find member in list
3. Click three-dot menu
4. Select Remove Member
5. Confirm removal

### What Happens

**Immediate effects:**

- Member loses all access to organization
- Organization removed from their list
- Cannot view organization data

**Data preservation:**

- Emails they created remain
- Contacts they added remain
- All work is preserved

### Restrictions

- Cannot remove yourself
- Cannot remove the last Admin

> To leave an organization, ask another Admin to remove you.

## Revoking Invitations

For pending invitations that haven't been accepted:

1. Go to Settings > Members
2. Find invitation in Pending Invitations
3. Click X button
4. Confirm revocation

The invitation link stops working immediately.

## Member Count

The page header shows total member count: Members (X)

There are no hard limits on team size.

## Best Practices

- If removing an Admin, promote a replacement first to maintain at least 2 Admins
- Remove members when they leave your team
- Verify removed members no longer have access

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Remove Member

**Possible causes:**

- You're not an Admin
- Trying to remove yourself
- Trying to remove last Admin

**Solution:** Have another Admin make the change, or promote someone else first.

### Cannot Change Role

You must be an Admin to change roles.
