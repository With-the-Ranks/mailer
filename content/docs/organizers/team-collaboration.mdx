## Getting Started

### For Organization Owners

When you sign up, a default organization is created with you as Admin.

To customize your organization:

1. Go to Settings > Organization

3. Click Save Changes

### For Team Members

When invited to an organization:

1. Click invitation link from email
2. Sign in or create account
3. Accept invitation

## Best Practices

- Use email invitations for known team members
- Set expiration dates on shareable links
- Keep at least 2 Admins to prevent organization lockout
- Remove members when they leave your team
