# Segments

Segments let you save filters as reusable groups to target specific contacts in your campaigns.

## Creating a Segment

### From Filters

1. Open your Master List
2. Apply filters (custom fields, tags, location, etc.)
3. Click Create Segment
4. Name your segment
5. Add optional description
6. Click Save

The segment automatically includes all contacts matching your current filters.

### From Selected Contacts

1. Select specific contacts using checkboxes
2. Click Create Segment
3. Name your segment
4. Click Save

This creates a static segment with only the selected contacts.

## Types of Segments

### Dynamic Segments

Based on filter criteria. Contact count updates automatically as your data changes.

**Example:** All contacts with custom field "Status = Active" will always include newly added active contacts.

### Static Segments

Based on specific contact selection. List stays the same unless manually updated.

**Example:** Manually selected 50 contacts for a one-time campaign.

## Using Segments

### Sending Campaigns

When creating an email campaign, select a segment to send to only those contacts.

### Viewing Segment Contacts

Click on a segment to see all contacts in that group.

## Managing Segments

### Viewing Your Segments

Go to Organization > Segments to see all saved segments showing:

- Segment name
- Contact count
- Description
- Creation date

### Editing Segments

1. Click on a segment
2. Update name or description
3. Click Save

> Filter criteria cannot be edited. Create a new segment with different filters instead.

### Deleting Segments

1. Click the menu icon on a segment
2. Select Delete
3. Confirm deletion

> Deleting a segment does not delete contacts.

## Best Practices
