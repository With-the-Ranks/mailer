# Resend Integration

Mailer uses Resend as the email provider. You can set up your own Resend account for full control over your email sending.

## Why Use Your Own Resend Account?

- Custom domains - Send from your own verified domain
- Better deliverability - Control your own sender reputation
- Advanced tracking - Access to Resend's analytics dashboard

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Resend Account

Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and sign up for an account.

### 2. Get Your API Key

Navigate to [API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys) in your Resend dashboard and create a new API key.

> Security Tip: Create a key with only "Send emails" permissions.

### 3. Add Your API Key to Mailer

1. Go to your Organization Settings
2. Find the "Email API Key" section
3. Paste your Resend API key
4. Click "Save"

Your organization will now use your Resend account for all email sending.

## Setting Up Custom Domains

### Add Domain to Resend

1. Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain
4. Add the DNS records provided by Resend

### DNS Records

Resend will provide you with specific DNS records to add. These include:

- SPF records
- DKIM records
- DMARC records (recommended)

### Verify Domain

1. Return to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Wait for DNS verification (usually 24-48 hours)
3. Status will change to "Verified" when ready

### Use Custom Domain in Mailer

Once verified, your domain will appear in your organization's domain list:

1. Go to Organization Settings
2. In the "Active Sending Domain" section
3. Select your verified domain from the dropdown

All emails from this organization will now be sent from your custom domain.

## Custom Send-From Address

With a verified domain, you can send from any address on that domain.

Simply update the "from" field when creating emails in Mailer.

## Troubleshooting

### Domain Not Verifying

- Check DNS records are correctly added
- Wait 24-48 hours for propagation
- Verify TXT record format is correct

### Low Deliverability

- Ensure SPF, DKIM, DMARC are all configured
- Clean your email lists
- Warm up new domains gradually
- Monitor and remove hard bounces

### API Key Not Working

- Verify the key is correctly pasted
- Check key has "Send emails" permission
- Ensure key hasn't been revoked in Resend dashboard
